This repository is a DataPink flavor of RoboSat, including our latests developments.

Spirit:
-------
- Cutting edge Computer Vision research papers implementation 
- Industrial code robustness
- Several tools, you can combine together (as Lego)
- Extensible, by design
- High performances
- Minimalism as a code aesthetic
- GeoSpatial standards compliancy
- OSM and MapBox ecosystems friendly


Aims:
-----
- DataSet Quality Analysis
- Change Detection highlighter
- Features extraction and completion


Install:
-------

**1) Prerequisites:**
   - Python >= 3.6 and PyTorch >= 0.4 installed, with related Nvidia GPU drivers, CUDA and CUDNN libs.
   - At least one GPU, with RAM GPU >= 6Go (default batch_size settings is targeted to 11Go).
   - Libs with headers: libjpeg, libwebp, libbz2, zlib, libboost. And Qt dependancies: libsm and libxrender.
     On a recent Ubuntu-server, could be done with:
 ```
     apt-get install build-essential libboost-python-dev zlib1g-dev libbz2-dev libjpeg-turbo8-dev libwebp-dev libsm6 libxrender1
 ```

 **2) Python libs Install:**
```
     python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```
  NOTA: if you want to significantly increase performances switch from Pillow to <a href="https://github.com/uploadcare/pillow-simd">Pillow-simd</a>.


 **3) Deploy:**
  - Move the `rsp` command to a bin directory covered by your `PATH` (or update your `PATH`)
  - Move the robosat_pink dir to somewhere covered by your `PYTHONPATH` (or update your `PYTHONPATH`)
